# HTML5andCSS3_ResponsivePage
My final assignment for my HTML5 and CSS3 course I have made for the Front End Web Development Certification program

This webpage demonstrates my abilities and understanding of creating a responsive webpage based on what platform you are viewing the page
on, whether for mobile or Desktop. The layout of this page changes based on the width of the page.
